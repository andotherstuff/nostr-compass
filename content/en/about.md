Nostr Compass is a technical resource for the Nostr protocol, providing
developers, relay operators, and builders with the information they need
to stay current on protocol evolution.

We publish [weekly newsletters][] covering NIP proposals, client updates,
relay developments, and notable code changes. Our [podcast][] features
conversations with the developers whose work is covered in each newsletter.
The [topic index][topics] documents key Nostr concepts with links to primary
sources and our coverage.
