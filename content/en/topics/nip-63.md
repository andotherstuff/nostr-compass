NIP-63 is a proposed standard for handling gated content within the Nostr protocol, allowing creators to require payment before revealing content.

## How It Works

Content creators can publish events where the full content is encrypted or hidden behind a paywall. After payment verification, the content is unlocked for the paying user.

## Use Cases

- Subscriber-only articles
- Premium media content
- Pay-per-view events
- Exclusive access to creators
