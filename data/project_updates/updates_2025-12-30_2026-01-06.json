          "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the background crashes with termination code\r\n0xdead10cc.\r\n\r\nThose crashes were caused by the fact that NostrDB was being stored on\r\nthe shared app container (Because our app extensions need NostrDB\r\ndata), and iOS kills any process that holds a file lock after the\r\nprocess is backgrounded.\r\n\r\nOther developers in the field have run into similar problems in the past\r\n(with shared SQLite databases or shared SwiftData), and they generally\r\nrecommend not to place those database in shared containers at all,\r\nmentioning that 0xdead10cc crashes are almost inevitable otherwise:\r\n\r\n- https://ryanashcraft.com/sqlite-databases-in-app-group-containers/\r\n- https://inessential.com/2020/02/13/how_we_fixed_the_dreaded_0xdead10cc_cras.html\r\n\r\nSince iOS aggressively backgrounds and terminates processes with tight\r\ntiming constraints that are mostly outside our control (despite using\r\nApple's recommended mechanisms, such as requesting more time to perform\r\nclosing operations), this fix aims to address the issue by a different\r\nstorage architecture.\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping NostrDB data on the shared app container and handling\r\nthe closure/opening of the database with the app lifecycle signals, keep\r\nthe main NostrDB database file in the app's private container, and instead\r\ntake periodic read-only snapshots of NostrDB in the shared container, so as\r\nto allow extensions to have recent NostrDB data without all the\r\ncomplexities of keeping the main file in the shared container.\r\n\r\nThis does have the tradeoff that more storage will be used by NostrDB\r\ndue to file duplication, but that can be mitigated via other techniques\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/damus-io/damus/issues/2638\r\nCloses: https://github.com/damus-io/damus/issues/3463\r\nChangelog-Fixed: Fixed background crashes with error code 0xdead10cc\r\nSigned-off-by: Daniel D\u2019Aquino <daniel@daquino.me>\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nCHOOSE YOUR CHECKLIST: \r\n- If this is an EXPERIMENTAL DAMUS LABS FEATURE, follow the \"Experimental Feature Checklist\" below and DELETE the \"Standard PR Checklist\"\r\n- If this is a STANDARD PR, follow the \"Standard PR Checklist\" below and DELETE the \"Experimental Feature Checklist\"\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Standard PR Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- DELETE THIS SECTION if this is an experimental Damus Labs feature -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read (or I am familiar with) the [Contribution Guidelines](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I have tested the changes in this PR\r\n- [x] I have profiled the changes to ensure there are no performance regressions, or I do not need to profile the changes.\r\n    - Utilize Xcode profiler to measure performance impact of code changes.

Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MostroP2P/mostro/main/keys/negrunch.asc | gpg --import\r\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MostroP2P/mostro/main/keys/arkanoider.asc | gpg --import\r\n```\r\nOnce you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming manifest.txt.sig.negrunch, manifest.txt.sig.arkanoider and manifest.txt are in the current directory) with:\r\n```bash\r\ngpg --verify manifest.txt.sig.negrunch manifest.txt\r\ngpg --verify manifest.txt.sig.arkanoider manifest.txt\r\n\r\ngpg: Signature made fri 10 oct 2025 11:28:03 -03\r\ngpg:                using RSA key 1E41631D137BA2ADE55344F73852B843679AD6F0\r\ngpg: Good signature from \"Francisco Calder\u00f3n <fjcalderon@gmail.com>\" [ultimate]\r\n\r\ngpg: Signature made fri 10 oct 2025 11:28:03 -03\r\ngpg:                using RSA key 2E986CA1C5E7EA1635CD059C4989CC7415A43AEC\r\ngpg: Good signature from \"Arkanoider <github.913zc@simplelogin.com>\" [ultimate]\r\n\r\n```\r\nThat will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries.

Next, depending on your operating system you should then re-calculate the sha256 sum of the binary, and compare that with the following hashes:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncat manifest-v1.0.0.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne can use the `shasum -a 256 <file name here>` tool in order to re-compute the `sha256` hash of the target binary for your operating system.

          "title": "refactor(llm): Modularize LLM Provider Registry Architecture",
          "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR introduces a modular, plugin-based architecture for LLM providers, replacing the monolithic switch statement in `LLMServiceFactory` with a scalable provider registry pattern that leverages AI SDK v6's `createProviderRegistry`.\n\n### Key Changes\n\n- **ProviderRegistry**: Central singleton managing provider lifecycle (registration, initialization, model creation)\n- **Base Classes**: `BaseProvider`, `StandardProvider`, `AgentProvider` for different provider types\n- **Individual Providers**: Each provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex CLI) in its own file\n- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with `ILLMProvider`, `ProviderMetadata`, and capability flags\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\n```\nsrc/llm/providers/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 types.ts                    # Provider interfaces and types\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts                    # Module exports and auto-registration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 base/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 BaseProvider.ts         # Abstract base class\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 StandardProvider.ts     # For AI SDK providers\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 AgentProvider.ts        # For agent-based providers\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 registry/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ProviderRegistry.ts     # Central registry singleton\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 standard/                   # Standard AI SDK providers\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 OpenRouterProvider.ts\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 AnthropicProvider.ts\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 OpenAIProvider.ts\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 OllamaProvider.ts\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 GeminiCliProvider.ts\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 agent/                      # Agent-based providers\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ClaudeCodeProvider.ts\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 CodexCliProvider.ts\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Scalability**: Add new providers by implementing `ILLMProvider` interface and adding to `ALL_PROVIDER_REGISTRATIONS`\n2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each provider is self-contained with its own initialization logic\n3. **Type Safety**: `ProviderMetadata` defines capabilities (streaming, tool calling, MCP support, etc.)\n4. **Testability**: Providers can be tested in isolation\n5. **AI SDK v6**: Properly leverages `createProviderRegistry` pattern\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n\n- `LLMServiceFactory` public API remains unchanged\n- Existing code continues to work without modifications\n\n## Test Plan\n\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes\n- [x] All existing LLM tests pass (same as master: 706 pass, 111 fail)\n- [x] No new test failures introduced\n- [ ] Manual testing with each provider type\n- [ ] Integration test with agent execution\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)",

          "title": "feat: implement agent supervision system with behavioral heuristics",
          "body": "## Summary\n\nImplements a modular Agent Supervision system that detects suspicious agent behaviors using heuristics, verifies them with an LLM supervisor, and re-engages agents with correction messages when issues are confirmed.\n\n### Key Changes\n\n- **New `src/agents/supervision/` module** with clean architecture:\n  - `types.ts` - Core interfaces and types for the supervision system\n  - `HeuristicRegistry.ts` - Pluggable registry for behavioral heuristics\n  - `SupervisorLLMService.ts` - LLM-based verification service\n  - `SupervisorOrchestrator.ts` - Main coordinator for checks\n\n- **Three behavioral heuristics implemented**:\n  1. **SilentAgentHeuristic** - Detects agents that complete without generating any output\n  2. **DelegationClaimHeuristic** - Catches when agent says \"I'll delegate to @agent\" but doesn't call the delegate tool\n  3. **PhaseAgentTodoHeuristic** - Ensures phase-managing agents set up a todo list before delegating\n\n- **AgentExecutor integration** - Post-completion supervision check before publishing finalization events\n\n- **LLM configuration** - Added `supervision` field to TenexLLMs with menu option in `tenex setup llm`\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nsrc/agents/supervision/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 types.ts                    # Core interfaces\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts                    # Public exports\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 registerHeuristics.ts       # Default heuristic registration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SupervisorLLMService.ts     # LLM verification service\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SupervisorOrchestrator.ts   # Main coordinator\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 heuristics/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 HeuristicRegistry.ts    # Pluggable registry\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 SilentAgentHeuristic.ts\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 DelegationClaimHeuristic.ts\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 PhaseAgentTodoHeuristic.ts\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. When an agent completes, post-completion heuristics check the output\n2. If a heuristic triggers (e.g., empty message), it builds evidence\n3. The SupervisorLLM verifies if this is a real violation or false positive\n4. If confirmed violation, a correction message is injected and the agent re-engages\n5. Max 3 retries before allowing publication to prevent infinite loops\n\n### Configuration\n\n```bash\ntenex setup llm\n# Select \"Supervision model\" to configure which LLM verifies heuristics\n```\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Unit tests for all three heuristics (detection, correction messages, actions)\n- [x] Unit tests for HeuristicRegistry\n- [x] Unit tests for SupervisorOrchestrator (state management, retry logic)\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes\n- [x] All 42 tests pass\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)",
